# tiny-iiif-manifest-authoring-tool
A tiny authoring tool for IIIF manifests with the function of serving as a IIIF Image hosting service.

# Overview
IIIF is an extremely useful framework for publishing image resources in an interoperable way. However, for individuals or small groups, publishing images using IIIF may not always be straightforward due to the technical complexities involved in tasks such as hosting IIIF Images and editing IIIF Manifests.

This web application, based on Express.js, enables individuals and small groups to easily publish IIIF resources through a simple set of steps. Specifically, it provides a straightforward web interface for the following tasks:

1. Upload images and publish them in the IIIF Image format (mostly achieved by [iiif-processor](https://github.com/samvera/node-iiif) ).
2. Editing IIIF manifests that reference these images.

# Dependencies
To use this application, you need to have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

# Getting Started
